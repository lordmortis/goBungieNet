# goBungieNet

Bungie.Net API for Golang

# Developing

## Prerequisites

You will need a [properly setup](https://golang.org/doc/install) Go development environment to use this.

## Getting code and all dependencies

Once you have your GOPATH setup as above you should:

  1. `go get github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure`
  2. `go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3`

If you are testing with the main.go file you should have a registered API key.

 1. `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lordmortis/goBungieNet`
 2. `go run *.go`
